See Report.pdf for full results.

## PartA - Anger Detection with Machine learning classification
This part deals with detecting anger levels during the TubeStrike. 
- parsing Tweets
- pre-processing
- training a classifier 
- predicting anger levels for each hour during the tubestrike
Anger levels were defined as a percentage of angry Tweets.
- Number of angry tweets / Total number of tweets
## PartB - Bigrams
This part was creating probability distributions of bigrams of words (word1, word2) and which bigrams were more likely to occur during the tube strike, as compared to a random day.
- Maximum likelihood estimation (MLE)
- Laplace
This showed that the words such as "Work", "Tube", "Strike", "#tubestrik" were unsurpricingly more likely to occurr during the tube strike.
